# web-scraping-challenge

This project utilizes splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape images and data from 4 space focused websites. Those images and data are then rendered onto a new html page Mars Facts using a Flask API and mongo database. The final site is interactive and allows the user to scrape updated images and facts with the click of a button!
